# BRICK CITY SHOWDOWN
our submission
# Team Members:
- Steve Wufeng(I worked on both back-end and front-end on the project. Worked with logic of the game, and GUI for user interaction. Keep all parties connected and on the same page on our project progress.)
- Jack Hunsberger
- Sebastian Hernandez
- Kelly Chen (I created an outline of a shmup game and drew all the artworks to the game.)

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the game Undertale with its unique gameplay along with the classic game of asteroid, so we combined the two together to create something new.

## What it does
In the game, the player plays as Rickie fighting against dorm rat launching a bacteria attack. Using the arrow keys, the player can control Rickie to either dodge the incoming bacteria falling down or shoot them down with hand sanitizer. If Rickie's health falls below 0 before the dorm rat's health, the game ends in a defeat for the player. If the dorm rat's health reaches 0, then the player wins the game and the victory screen is displayed. 

## How we built it
We built it using python and pygame.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was learning a new library, pygame, in a short amount of time. We had issues with the same bacteria continuously attacking the player as it pass through as well as bacteria spawning too fast for the players to dodge. In the end, we created an invisibility phase for the player sprite after they were hit to stop the player from taking continuous damage and froze some of the bacteria to slow down the rate they were falling. Working online was also a challenge for us since it makes it hard to know who is doing which part at what time and things were a bit messy at the beginning, but eventually we organized everything on Github and things became a lot smoother. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One accomplishment we're proud of is being able to create a game within 24 hrs with pygame. All of us came into the hackathon knowing nothing about pycharm and we were able to create a functional game at the end. Another accomplishment that we're proud of is creating the whole game with artworks and music that are created by members of our team.

## What we learned
We learned how to code python with pygame, how to draw pixel art. 

## What's next for Brick City Showdown
We plan on adding more levels to the game and making powerups for the player to collect to boost their movement speed or bullet speed as the levels get increasingly harder. We also plan on adding a replay button so that players can replay the game after it ends.
